# vikings-story
An unfinished tower-defense game made with Python 2.7 and Pygame.
Haven't been working on it since 2014.

I've put a lot of (teenage) years into this project, but it grew
and grew like a bubble and became too cumbersome to continue working
on.

If you're reading the source or playing the game, please bear in mind
that this was mostly a learning project. From time to time I view the
code and see how much I've progressed from that.
